#### Project Description

Our task was to implement a spell check system from scratch. Provided a list of words, our goal was to use a Longest-Common Subsequence detector to solve this problem. Implemented in Java, we used Java's built in ArrayList data structure to hold a given list of words as well as to hold a list of possible correct spellings per the user input. Finally, our interface cosists of the program automatically prompting the user through the duration of it's functionality.

#### Running Our Project

Our project is written in Java so please ensure you have a relatively recent version of Java on your computer.

You can check this by running:
`java -version` from your command line.

Once you are sure your machine contains a Java download, you can run our program by running the file `SpellCheck.java` located in our project's `311-project/src/` directory. Once running, the program will ask for a user input where you can type a singular word, and the program will return to you what our algorithm deems it's correct spelling to be.
